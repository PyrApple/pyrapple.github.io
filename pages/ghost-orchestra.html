      <!-- <h3>Project Description</h3> -->

      <p>The aim of the Ghost Orchestra project was to investigate our perception of space through sound and images. The journey started with a concert, organized to celebrate the 850th birthday of the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral, staging a symphonic orchestra accompanying soloists and choirs through J. Massenet oratorio “La Vierge”.</p>

      <p>During the event, each instrument was recorded, the audio tracks later to be used in a recreation of the concert in a virtual reproduction of the cathedral. To reproduce the exact acoustic of the building, the room impulse responses from instruments to potential listener positions were simulated – 3rd order ambisonic IR from a <a class="text-faded link-url" href="http://www.catt.se/">CATT-Acoustic</a> model of the cathedral – and convolved with the audio tracks.</p>

      <p>The visual model of the cathedral itself was created in <a class="text-faded link-url" href="http://www.autodesk.fr/products/3ds-max/overview">3DS MAX</a>, exported in <a class="text-faded link-url" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> for real-time rendering (based on the <a class="text-faded link-url" href="https://blendervr.limsi.fr/doku.php">BlenderVR</a> add-on for Oculus DK2 rendering and on Blender Cycles for 360° player).</p>

      <h3>Miscellaneous devs</h3>

      <p>As one of the project requirements was to animate visual instrument based on their associated audio tracks, I had to test various designs of audio-visualizers in the Blender Game Engine, based on Video Textures, custom shaders, physics, etc. Here are some example implementations.</p>

      <h4>Vertex Shader based Audio-Visualizer (source code at <a class="text-faded link-url" href="https://github.com/PyrApple/bge-audio-visualizer">Github</a>)</h4>
