                The thesis objective was to design a device to assist rescuers during search and rescue operations, providing victims localisation based on the electromagnetic waves emitted by their cellphones. Said device was to be lightweight enough to be backpacked and guide rescuers in their navigation towards a given victim, like a compass. The core of the thesis focused on the interface of this "Direction Finder" (DF): it had to be based on audio only, providing rescuers with an eyes and hands free guidance system.

            <p>The whole creation pipeline was based on virtual prototyping: allowing to test various direction finder designs in a controlled virtual environment prior to their implementation as physical prototypes.</p>
