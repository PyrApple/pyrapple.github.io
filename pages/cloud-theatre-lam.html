      <h2>A Cloud Theatre</h2>

      <h3>Project Description</h3>

      <p>The objective of the Cloud Theatre project is to create a realistic auralization of a theatre play in the Athénée Theatre (Paris). Two actors are recorded (audio and video) performing ''Ubu Roi, Act I'' in an anechoic environment. The audio recordings are used to create an auralization of the actors, using a 3D calibrated model of the Theatre (CATT Acoustics). The visual recordings, realised with a Kinect v2 (depth and RGB feeds), are used to create 3D point clouds of the actors, projected in the virtual environment. The position and orientation of actors' head is extracted from the video recordings and used to simulate head position and voice directivity in the auralization. A virtual audience is added to the theatre, simulated based on a procedural set of sounds and animations. The final 360° and flat renderings are created using Blender Cycles. The overall simulation is repeated for several spectator positions in the Theatre, the final material is used to study the impact of said position on visual and acoustic perception of the theatre play.</p>
