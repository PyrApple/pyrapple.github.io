      <h2 class="text-left"> Scaled Head (2019) </h2>

      <p>The objective of this project was to create a 1/8 scaled version of the Neumann <a href="https://en-de.neumann.com/ku-100">KU-100</a> head to use for binaural measurements in scale models.</p>

      <h3>From 3D model to 3D printing</h3>

      <p>Modeling was based on a MRI scan of the dummy head, imported into Blender as a high resolution mesh. We adapted the mesh so that a pair of microphones could later be fitted behind each ear-drum.</p>

      <p>We then sent the 3D model for printing to <a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/">Sculpteo</a> while we dabbled on our side with Orsay's FabLab <a href="https://ultimaker.com/">Ultimaker 2</a>. The difference in resolution is somewhat obvious in the picture below, where the Ultimaker was used to print the blue head and ear (square blob on the left), ...</p>

      <p> ... and Sculpteo sent us the gray model on the right and below.</p>

      <p> The scaled head was finally fitted onto a stand (plans have been made to print a 3D torso at some point).</p>

      <h3> Fitting the microphones </h3>

      <p> We initially had plans to design our own amplifier, to work with a pair of <a href="https://www.knowles.com/">Knowles</a> microphones. After breaking and burning a few capsules, we went and asked <a href="http://feichter-audio.com/">Feichter Audio</a> for help. They kindly helped us, neatly embedding the circuit into the XLR adapter.</p>

      </div>

      <p> All that remained was to characterize the frequency response of the resulting circuit, to ensure that it would behave on the “scaled” audible spectrum (from 160Hz up to 160kHz).</p>

      <p> As can be seen on the picture above, the current characteristic (“in 1, FG” blue curve) limits the binaural head to applications below 45kHz (5.6kHz once scaled).</p>
