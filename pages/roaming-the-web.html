          A fan-fiction written by a researcher in artificial intelligence, re-inventing Potter’s story based on the one hypothesis that Harry is a rationalist. Great on it’s own, grand if you liked the original novels. (I’d advise to go for the audiobook version).

          The superbe adventure of Taylor Hebert, a recently empowered bug-controlling teenager, with whom I undergone what afterwards feels like a lifetime of ups and downs through saving asses and world altogether. The audiobook version is truly worth it: realized by fans, low quality (be it technical or otherwise) for a rare few chapters, brilliant otherwise.
