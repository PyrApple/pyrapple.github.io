        <li><a href="https://github.com/polarch/">A. Politis Github</a>, where one can find some neat libraries of Matlab functions for 3D sound simulation: Ambisonic Encoding, Spherical-Harmonic-Transform, Vector-Based-Amplitude-Panning, Array Response Simulator, etc.</li>

        <li>Listening to what <a href="https://toni.org/a3d/">games using A3D</a> (3D audio plugin) were capable of in the mid 90’s makes me wonder what has truly been achieved since then..</li>

      <h3>Books</h3>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs">
          <h5>Harry Potter and the methods of rationality</h5>
          <p><a href="http://hpmor.com/"><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/hpmor-logo.jpg"  alt=""></a></p>
          <p>
            A fan-fiction written by a researcher in artificial intelligence, re-inventing Potter’s story based on the one hypothesis that Harry is a rationalist. Great on it’s own, grand if you liked the original novels. (I’d advise to go for the audiobook version).
          </p>

          <h5>Worm</h5>
          <p><a href="http://audioworm.rein-online.org/">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/worm-logo.jpg"  alt=""></a></p>
          <p>
            The superbe adventure of Taylor Hebert, a recently empowered bug-controlling teenager, with whom I undergone what afterwards feels like a lifetime of ups and downs through saving asses and world altogether. The audiobook version is truly worth it: realized by fans, low quality (be it technical or otherwise) for a rare few chapters, brilliant otherwise.
