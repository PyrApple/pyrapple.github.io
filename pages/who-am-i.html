<h2 class="text-left"> Who am I </h2>

<p>
	I’m a researcher, presently focused on sound spatialisation, perception, and room acoustics simulation for virtual and augmented realities. I studied these fields along with signal processing and computer sciences at <a href="http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr/">d’Alembert Institute</a>, <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/">Imperial College London</a>, <a href="https://www.ircam.fr/">IRCAM</a>, <a href="https://www.limsi.fr/en/">LIMSI</a>, and <a href="https://www.etis-lab.fr/">ETIS</a> labs. With a background in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, I obtained a Master’s degree in signal processing and telecommunications from the <a href="https://www.ensea.fr/en">ENSEA</a> graduate school of Electrical Engineering (France) in 2011, and received a Ph.D. degree in acoustics, signal processing, and computer science from <a href="http://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en">Sorbonne University</a> (Paris VI, France) in May 2015.
