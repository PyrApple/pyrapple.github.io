      <h2>Evaa (WIP)</h2>

      <p>This project is an ongoing work on assessing the impact of room acoustics on musicians interpretation throughout the ages. We're currently developping the framework for real-time auralization, the tricky part being to account for sources directivity while using top-notch (i.e. pre-rendered) room impulse responses. Next step will be to recreate the visuals and acoustics of present and past rooms and concert halls to start experimenting.</p>
